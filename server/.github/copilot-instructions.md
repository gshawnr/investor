# Testing

---

All tests are written in the '/src/tests/{subfolder}' directory. The test files are named after the source files they are testing.

When writing tests, follow these guidelines:
Group test directories to align with the source code directories.
Unit tests directories are in the 'tests/unit' directory.
Ensure there is a successful case, fail case and edge case for each tested function or method.
Before writing a test file, review the source file to understand the code and its dependencies.
Ensure all mocks are in place and the test file is self-contained.
Review any other test files in the same directory to ensure consistency.
